    Underlying everything above is the concept of 'combining' expressions together, which happens when two expressions are written next to each other in Maraca.
    ",
    "
    Multiple expressions next to each other are combined pairwise, from left to right, so the following are equivalent.
    ",
    code?.["a b c d", "(((a b) c) d)"],
    "
    For every pair, the operation applied depends on the types being combined (out of nil, value, and list).
    ",

    ],
    "
    Combining nil and value expressions joins the string values together, treating nil as the empty string. If neither value is nil and there are any spaces between the expressions, a single space is added between the strings.

    "
    Combining nil or a value with a list performs a key lookup on the list. The expressions can be either way round.

    "
    The dot operator also performs combination, but at a lower precedence than direct combinations. This is useful for avoiding lots of parentheses, for example the following are equivalent.
