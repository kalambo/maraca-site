    In Maraca, two expressions written next to each other are 'combined'. Multiple expressions next to each other are combined pairwise, from left to right, so the following are equivalent.

    Combining nil and value expressions joins the string values together, treating nil as the empty string. If neither value is nil and there are any spaces between the expressions, a single space is added between the strings.

    Combining nil or a value with a list performs a key lookup on the list. The expressions can be either way round.

    "
    The dot operator also performs combination, but at a lower precedence than direct combinations. This is useful for avoiding lots of parentheses, for example the following are equivalent.
    ",
    code?.["(User?)(Profile)(Last name)", "User?.Profile.Last name"],
    "
    Also, the dot operator behaves differently for nil/value combinations, treating nil as an empty list. This allows for nested key lookups on potentially nil values.
